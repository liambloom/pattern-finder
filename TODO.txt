I have done:
Polynomial
Exponential

I will do:
Fibonacci-like

I may do:
Trig
Absolute value
Rational


I will not do:
Radical - Because it would require inputting and storing irrational numbers
Logarithmic - Test, but I think it probably has the same problems as radical
Conic Sections - Not valid functions because they often produce 2 outputs for one input.
